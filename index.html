  <h1>21 Choices Website</h1>
  <h5>PROJECT PROMPT</h5>
  <p>The goal of this assignment is for you to practice the workflow of redesigning a simple website.
    You should take away the skills necessary to analyze and identify flaws in an existing interface,
    create low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various screen sizes, and build a responsive
    website based on those prototypes.</p>

      <h2>Part 1 : Website Analysis</h2>
      <div class="project-section-title-bar"></div> 
      
      <h5>WEBPAGE SCREENSHOT & DESCRIPTION</h5>
      <p>For this assignment, I chose to redesign the 21 Choices website, specifically the online order location selection page.
        21 Choices is a family-owned frozen yogurt store located in Southern California. I chose this webpage because as someone who 
        frequently goes to 21 Choices (it's personally one of my favorite dessert shops!), I am annoyed/saddened by how poor the website
        design is in comparison to their sweet treats.
      </p>
      
      <div class="banner-image">
        <img src="./assets/screenshot.png" alt="website screenshot" width=60%>
      </div>
  
      <a href="http://www.21choices.com/pick-online-order-location"target="_blank"><button>VISIT WEBPAGE</button></a>

      <h5>USABILITY ANALYSIS</h5>
      <p>First, I conducted a usability analysis on the webpage using the three criteria of 
        learnability, memorability, and efficiency. 
      </p>
      <div class="banner-image">
        <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/usability.png" alt="usability analysis" width=80%>
      </div>
      
      <h5>ACCESSIBILITY</h5>
      <p>Then, I used the WAVE Accessbility program, which identified a few issues with the
        accessbility as well. 
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Heading:</strong> The heading sizes and components on the webpage are inconsistent and highly
          varied. This can be confusing and reduces the semantic and visual meaning and structure to the page.</li>
          <li><strong>Empty button:</strong> There are 2 empty buttons on the site, which are buttons 
          with no text on them to indicate where the button leads to. However, I do not agree with this
          evaluation because I could not find the empty buttons.</li>
          <li><strong>Alt text:</strong> Several images had "suspicious" or "non-descriptive" alternate text descriptions.
            For example, the Claremont store image simply had the alt text "Claremont," which is vague.
            This negatively impacts accessbility for visually impaired people, such as blind users who rely 
            on alt text to experience images.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br>

      <h2>Part 2 : Visual Redesign</h2>
      <div class="project-section-title-bar"></div> 
      
      <h5>LOW-FIDELITY WIREFRAMING</h5>
      <p>Based on the usability and accessibility analyses, I used Balsamiq to create 3 low-fidelity wireframes
        (for desktop, tablet, and mobile) outlining how the website could be improved. 
      </p>
      <div class="banner-image">
        <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/lowfi.png" alt="usability analysis" width=110%>
      </div>
      
      <h5>VISUAL DESIGN STYLE GUIDE</h5>
      <p>I also created a visual design style guide to increase consistency and cohesion for the high-fidelity prototypes. 
      </p>
      <div class="banner-image">
        <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/visualguide.png" alt="visual guide" width=60%>
      </div>
      
      <h5>HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPING</h5>
      <p>I then used Figma to create high-fidelity prototypes based on the low-fidelity wireframes. 
      </p>
      <div class="banner-image">
        <img class="gallery-item" src="./assets/highfi.png" alt="high fidelity prototypes" width=110%>
      </div>
      <br>

      <h2>Part 3 : Responsive Redesign</h2>
      <div class="project-section-title-bar"></div> 
     
      <h5>WEBSITE REDESIGN</h5>
      <p>Finally, I used HTML and CSS to recreate the 21 Choices website according to the high-fidelity prototypes. Buttons and
        navigational elements are replaced with dummy elements. </p>
